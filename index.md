    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="profile-description">
      I am Jongho Park, a Ph.D course student in POSTECH(Pohang University of Science and Technology). 
      My Philosophy is helping retail investors making rational and well-suited financial decisions (e.g. Retirement, Portfolio Management, Bequest etc.). For my philosophy, I think introducing data-driven approach to traditional optimization theory is necessary and efficient approach for this field.
