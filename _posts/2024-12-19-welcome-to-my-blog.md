Welcome to my research blog! I'm Jongho Park, a Ph.D. student at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology) focusing on the intersection of financial engineering and machine learning.

## What This Blog Will Cover

This blog will serve as a platform for sharing my research insights, thoughts on financial markets, and developments in the field of data-driven finance. I'll be writing about:

- **Deep Learning Applications in Finance**: Neural networks for portfolio optimization, stochastic control theory
- **Household Finance Research**: Retirement planning, behavioral biases, and financial decision-making
- **Portfolio Management**: Risk modeling, alternative data integration, and ESG investing
- **Industry Collaborations**: Real-world applications of academic research in banking and fintech

## My Research Philosophy

My core belief is that retail investors deserve access to sophisticated, data-driven financial strategies. Traditional optimization theory combined with modern machine learning techniques can democratize financial expertise and help individuals make better financial decisions.

## Upcoming Posts

I'm planning to write about:
- The impact of COVID-19 on cryptocurrency herding behavior
- Neural network approaches to pension fund asset allocation
- Personal fund recommendation systems for retail banking
- Integration of news sentiment in FX forecasting models

Stay tuned for regular updates on my research progress and insights into the evolving landscape of financial technology and quantitative finance.
