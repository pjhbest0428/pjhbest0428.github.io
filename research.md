My research focuses on the intersection of financial engineering, machine learning, and behavioral finance. I am particularly interested in developing data-driven solutions that help retail investors make more rational financial decisions.

## Deep Learning for Stochastic Control Theory

### Overview
I explore the application of deep learning techniques to solve complex stochastic control problems in finance, particularly in portfolio optimization and dynamic asset allocation.

### Key Research Areas
- **Neural Network-based Policy Optimization**: Using deep reinforcement learning to solve high-dimensional portfolio optimization problems
- **Stochastic Differential Equations**: Leveraging neural ODEs and physics-informed neural networks for financial modeling
- **Dynamic Programming Solutions**: Implementing deep learning approaches to overcome the curse of dimensionality in traditional dynamic programming

### Applications
- Pension fund asset allocation under regulatory constraints
- Multi-period portfolio optimization with transaction costs
- Real-time risk management in volatile markets

## Household Finance

### Overview
My research in household finance focuses on understanding and improving individual financial decision-making processes, particularly in the context of retirement planning and wealth management.

### Key Research Areas
- **Retirement Planning**: Optimal withdrawal strategies and lifecycle portfolio management
- **Behavioral Biases**: Identifying and mitigating cognitive biases in financial decision-making
- **Financial Literacy**: Impact of financial education on investment outcomes
- **Robo-Advisory Systems**: Developing algorithmic solutions for personalized financial advice

### Current Projects
- Analysis of herding behavior in cryptocurrency markets during COVID-19
- Development of personalized fund recommendation systems for retail banking
- Study of optimal asset allocation under changing regulatory environments

## Portfolio Management

### Overview
I work on both theoretical and practical aspects of portfolio management, combining traditional optimization theory with modern machine learning techniques.

### Key Research Areas
- **Risk Management**: Advanced risk modeling using machine learning techniques
- **Alternative Data Integration**: Incorporating news sentiment, social media data, and alternative datasets into portfolio construction
- **Derivatives Pricing**: Development of robust pricing models for complex financial instruments
- **ESG Integration**: Sustainable investing and ESG factor integration in portfolio optimization

### Methodologies
- **Machine Learning**: Random forests, neural networks, and ensemble methods for return prediction
- **Natural Language Processing**: Sentiment analysis of financial news and earnings calls
- **High-Frequency Data Analysis**: Processing and modeling ultra-high-frequency trading data
- **Regime Switching Models**: Adaptive portfolio strategies under changing market conditions

## Industry Collaborations

### Recent Projects
- **Hanabank (2024)**: FX rate forecasting using news sentiment analysis
- **KBbank (2023)**: Personalized fund recommendation system development  
- **Metanet Fintech (2022)**: Derivatives pricing engine optimization

### Research Philosophy
I believe that bridging the gap between academic research and practical implementation is crucial. My work emphasizes:
- **Practical Applicability**: Ensuring research outcomes can be implemented in real-world financial systems
- **Data-Driven Approaches**: Leveraging big data and machine learning to enhance traditional financial models
- **Retail Investor Focus**: Developing solutions that democratize sophisticated financial strategies for individual investors

## Future Research Directions
